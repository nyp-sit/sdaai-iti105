# ITI105 Machine Learning Project

## Module Objective

In this module, you will implement a practical machine learning system that solves a real-world problem in a selected domain. You will have an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skill sets acquired in other PDC1 modules to analyse the problem and develop a solution using machine learning approach.

## Module Learning Outcomes
1. Identify and select a suitable machine learning model for a given problem and data set
2. Develop and deploy a machine learning application using appropriate software framework and tools
3. Apply model tuning and optimization to improve performance of machine learning systems
4. Evaluate machine learning models using appropriate metrics for efficiency and effectiveness

## Project Team

You are expected to form a project team of 3 to 4 members. 

Each member should own one focus area (e.g. ML model experimentation, feature engineering, etc) and be able to complete the associated tasks independently. Marks will be deducted for individuals who rely heavily on others to complete their tasks.

The role of project mentor is to provide guidance on your project proposal, and to make sure you are on the right track in your milestones and final presentation and report. 

Please fill up the [online form](https://forms.gle/7ejrGV6KRLNgbDX36) of your project team members.

## Deliverables and Assessment Components

This project consists of the following assessment components:

|Assessment components|Group|Individual|Total|
|----|---|---|---|
|Project Proposal|10%||10%|
|Milestones|10%|15%|25%|
|Final Presentation|10%|30%|40%|
|Final Report|10%|15%|25%|

## Project Proposal

In the project proposal, your team will pick a problem from the given **[list of projects](./project-list.md)**, formulating it as a machine learning problem to work on early and receive feedback from project mentors.

Once you have identified the problem, it can be useful to research on some prior work or research on the related topics. Another important aspect of your project is to identify one or several datasets suitable for your chosen problem. If that data needs considerable pre-processing  to suit your task, or that you intend to collect the needed data yourself, bear in mind that data collection is only one part of the entire project scope, but can often take up sizeable amount of time. You are still expected to have solid methodology and discussion of results, so pace your project accordingly.

Your project proposal should include the following information:

- Formulation: What problem are you going solve? What are the appropriate metrics  to use to measure success? How do you frame it as machine learning problem? 
- Dataset: What kind of data you need and how do you plan to collect them? If it is some existing dataset, include reference to the dataset and provide some discussion how the data was collected. 
- Methods: What kind of ML approach are you planning to use? 
- Intended experiments: What experiments are you planning to run? How do you plan to evaluate your machine learning models?
- Deployment: How do you intend to use the model? Provide an overview of how the model is used in the overall solution.


### Datasets

While we do not expect you to have to spend too much time collecting raw data, the process of inspecting and visualizing the data, trying out different types of preprocessing, and doing error analysis is often an important part of machine learning. Hence if you choose to use pre-prepared datasets (e.g. from Kaggle, the UCI machine learning repository, Google Datasets.) you are strongly encouraged to do some data exploration and analysis to get familiar with the problem. You are also expected to understand the approach and the techniques used to collect the data, even if you are **NOT** actually doing it.

## Milestones
The Milestone report should describe what you've accomplished so far, and very briefly say what else you plan to do. It should be written as an **“early draft"** of your final report so that you can re-use most of the milestone content in your final report. The milestone report will serve as checkpoint for us to know if you are on the right track and making good progress.

Your milestone report (and final report) should focus on the problem to be solved, and provides discussion on experimental results and comparisons, etc. and should not be a tutorial/lecture on what SVM is, e.g.

Please include a section that describes what each team member worked on and contributed to the project. This is to make sure team members are carrying a fair share of the work for projects. If you have any concerns working with one of your project teammates, please fill out the optional [teammate evaluation form](https://forms.gle/BX94y9PvGBbip1oP6) (only seen by the teaching staff). Please do not wait until last minute to raise your concerns. 

### Grading

The milestone is mostly intended to get feedback from project mentors to make sure you’re making reasonable progress. As long as your milestone follows the instructions above and you seem to have tested any assumptions which might prevent your team from completing the project, you should do well on the milestone.

### Format

Your milestone report should not be more than 12 pages, excluding references, and should include the following:

- Data: What kind of analysis and exploration you have done? What are the data preparation you have done?
- Method: What machine learning techniques have you tried and why?
- Preliminary experiments: Describe the experiments that you've run, the outcomes, and any error analysis that you've done. You should have tried at least one baseline.
- Next steps: Given your preliminary results, what are the next steps that you're considering?

### Experimental Log

You need to maintain an experimental log that captures ALL the experiments you have run (e.g. the different experimental parameters you have tried,  the results, and the error analysis.). This log will be helpful for you to understand what works and what does not. It also helps us to verify your work. It is no good to just report that you have tried MANY different models but cannot provide any discussion/proof on any of the models.

## Final Report

### Format

Final project report should not be more than 12 pages, excluding references.
Here's more detailed guidelines with a [rough outline](final-report-guidelines.pdf) of what we expect to see in the final report.

### Contributions
Please include a section that describes what each team member worked on and contributed to the project. If you have any concerns working with one of your project teammates, you can also fill out this optional teammate evaluation form (only seen by the teaching staff). We may reach out and factor in contributions and evaluations when assigning project grades.

### Code
Please include a zip file or preferably a link to a Github repository with the code for your final project. You do not have to include the data or additional libraries (so if you submit a zip file, it should not exceed 5MB).

### Grading
The final report will be judged based on the clarity of the report, the relevance of the project to topics taught in PDC1, the technical soundness of the methodology and algorithms used, and the quality of discussion of the experimental results.


## Final Presentation

During final presentation, you will be jointly assessed by more than one supervisor to ensure fairness in assessment. Among other things, you are required to show and explain the work you have done. You will be assessed based on your demonstrated understanding of the methodologies used and experimental results.

## Project mentors

The project teams will be jointly supervised by a group of project mentors. The project mentors and the contact info are listed below.
