The following is the list of problems you can work on (subject to changes):

1. Healthcare
    *  More and more people wanting to age in place and maintain their independence as long as possible. Being able to keep track of the activities of daily living (ADL) is important for healthcare professionals and caregivers to ensure the safety and quality of life for these elderly group of people.

2. Cybersecurity
    * Computing devices (including mobile phones) employ a variety of biometric authentication mechanisms to identify the user, such as finger prints or facial features. However, these authentication methods require specialized hardware which can add to the cost. A cheaper alternative is to authenticate user based on user's behaviour e.g. his/her typing dynamics.

3. Social/Lifestyle
    * Social media is becoming the main communication channel for most people. With more and more messages being sent through various messaging apps, people are demanding faster way of writing text. Smarter keyboard is thus important in predicting what the user is typing and automatically suggest a possible completion word, punctuation marks or emoji.

4. Cultural/Entertainment
    * The success of the song can often been measured by whether the song is on the Hit Chart such as  Billboard Hot 100. It is important for music labels to know what makes a song successful so that they can focus their budget on making songs that has the highest chance of being successful.

    or

    * With the growth of online media streaming services, the competition for market share has become more intense. Consumers are demanding good online experience. Instead of having to decide and choose what songs to play next, consumers should be presented with a recommended playlist that are most relevant to the consumer.

If you want to propose a *new problem* to work on, please approach your project mentors to seek their advice and approval.
